                            <h4>TuringSense Privacy Policy</h4>
                            <p>This TuringSense Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes TuringSense Inc.’s, its affiliates’, and subsidiaries’ (collectively “TuringSense”) practices regarding the collection, use, storage, sharing, and safeguarding of your information collected from any TuringSense-operated website, mobile application, product or service (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
                            <h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
                            <p>TuringSense may make changes to this Privacy Policy. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern TuringSense’s use of information about you and will be located at www.turingsense.com/policies/privacy.<br>
                            If TuringSense makes material changes to this Privacy Policy and if you have an account with us, TuringSense will notify you by posting a notice on the Service and sending an email to the address TuringSense has on file for your account. Please ensure this address remains current so you will receive updates.</p>
                            <h4>Categories of Personally Identifiable Information that TuringSense Collects</h4>
                            <p>TuringSense may collect information that you provide to TuringSense in connection with your use of the Service when you:  (A) register your account with TuringSense as a user of the Service (“Customers”); (B) make changes to your user profile information; (C) send email messages, forms, or other information to TuringSense or other users using the Service; (D) install, use or otherwise interact with the Service. This information may include your first and last name, address, email address, telephone number, profile photo, and any additional information you provide to TuringSense during the account registration process or via the Service.</p>
                            <p>When you use our products, you will be interacting with our fitness tracking sensors.  These sensors will transmit information to your mobile device via our mobile application and will collect information about your physical movements and the positioning of your body.  The Service may use this information to derive additional information, such as the type and frequency of activities that you may be performing while using the Service.<br>
                            TuringSense may also collect certain technical information about your use of the Service. This technical information may include information about your device(s), browser type and version, geo-location, computer, computer connection, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Service, Wi-Fi connection, internet protocol (“IP”) address, and standard web log.</p>
                            <p>Since TuringSense offers products and services related to your physical performance, we require certain information from you in order for you to use the Service.  When you register to use the Service, we require you to provide us with your contact e-mail and your height (“Required Information”).  You must provide this information in order to access and use the Service.  If you do not wish to provide this information, please do not access or use the Service.<br>
                            In order to facilitate our analysis of your physical performance, you may, but are not required to, provide us information about yourself that will help you enjoy the Service (“Optional Information”).  This information includes your weight, gender, and age.  Although you will not need to provide this information to us in order to access and use the Service, providing us this information will improve your experience with the Service.</p>
                            <p>Although we use third party service providers to process payments, when purchasing access to the Service, we may require you to provide our payment processing service providers with financial and billing information, such as billing name and address and your credit card number (“Financial Information”). We use Payment Card Industry (“PCI”)-certified third-party payment services and do not store your credit card information on our servers.  For more information, please refer to the section in this Privacy Policy entitled “Categories of Third-Party Persons or Entities With Whom TuringSense May Share Your Personally Identifiable Information.”  Required Contact Information, Financial Information, and Optional Information about Customers are referred to collectively as “Customer Data.”</p>
                            <h4>How TuringSense Collects Your Information; Tracking and Cookies</h4>
                            <p>When you register for an account with TuringSense, we may ask you to provide us with certain information in order to create your account, and to provide you with our services. This information is collected by us when you fill out forms that may be provided to you through the Service.</p>
                            <p>TuringSense, and third parties we interact with, including our third-party service providers, may use cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called "flash cookies"), and similar technologies in connection with your use of the Service to provide and support the Service (collectively referred to in this policy as "Cookies"). Cookies are small data files that may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our applications. Locally shared objects, or “flash cookies,” are data files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use. Locally stored objects are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your computer than cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.</p>
                            <p>If Cookies are used, they may be used to collect information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, preferences, data relating to content that has been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies may also be used in order to further features and processes on the Service, provide authentication and security for your transactions using the Service, store your preferences, facilitate relevant advertising, and help us learn more about how users engage with the Service.<br>
                            We sometimes use service providers to help us provide certain products and services or to integrate other features. These third-party service providers may collect information when you view or use them, including information about you and your device or browser and about your online activities over time and across different websites. They may do this using Cookies or similar technologies. These third-party service providers also may use Cookies or similar technologies to help share information with us, like how you use their website or application. To learn more about the information they collect or receive, review their privacy policies.</p>
                            <h4>How TuringSense Uses Your Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
                            <p>TuringSense may use information that TuringSense collects about you to: (A) provide access to the Service and to communicate with you; (B) personalize, customize, measure, and improve TuringSense’s services, content, and advertising; (C) prevent, detect, and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities or a breach of the applicable agreement(s) between you and TuringSense; (D) analyze the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Service; (E) generate and review reports and data about TuringSense’s user base and service usage patterns; (F) compile aggregate data for internal and external business purposes; and (G) resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.</p>

                            <h4>Submitted Data</h4>

Submitted Data may include an individual’s name, email address, phone number or any other data that the Customer chooses to submit to us. TuringSense generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom Submitted Data may pertain.  TuringSense processes Submitted Data on behalf of our Customers and any uses of Customer Data by TuringSense are done pursuant to our Terms of Service or a separate agreement in place between TuringSense and the applicable Customer, which exclusively governs our treatment of Submitted Data and supersedes this Privacy Policy in case of conflict, or as required by law. If your individual personal information has been submitted to us by a Customer as Submitted Data and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with the Customer (or his/her organization) directly.<br>
